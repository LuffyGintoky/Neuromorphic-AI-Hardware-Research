# Research Project on Neuromorphic AI Hardware Accelerators

This repository contains work conducted in a research project on AI hardware accelerators, Edge AI, and nanoelectronics for low-power artificial intelligence, as part of the ANID FONDECYT INICIACIÓN Project No. 11230679.

## Project Overview

This project explores cutting-edge hardware technologies and new computational frameworks for developing energy-efficient AI systems. The research focuses on alternatives to the von Neumann architecture, incorporating technologies such as spintronics and neuromorphic computing. As a result, a voice recognition AI model was developed using nanoelectronic devices that emulate neural networks directly on hardware, significantly reducing energy consumption.

### Specific Objectives

1. **Nanoelectronics-based AI Development**: Creation of a voice recognition model using nanoelectronics and neuromorphic computing.
2. **On-Hardware Neural Network Emulation**: Implementation of a reservoir computing approach using a Spin Torque Nano-Oscillator (STNO) as the hardware component.
3. **Performance Evaluation**: Model validation on the FSDD voice recognition dataset, achieving performance comparable to traditional deep architectures (CNNs, RNNs) but with significantly lower energy consumption.
4. **Exploration of Beyond-CMOS Technologies**: Research on technologies like spintronics to push the boundaries of modern AI hardware.

### Key Results

- Reduced neural network size by up to 1,000 times compared to traditional architectures.
- Achieved 90.5% accuracy in voice recognition tasks on a single STNO device with 10,000 trainable parameters.
- Significant reduction in energy consumption, highlighting STNO as an ideal nanoelectronic component for designing energy-efficient AI hardware.

## Repository Structure

- **GridSearchSimulations/**: Contains grid search simulations and experiments to evaluate model performance under different configurations.
